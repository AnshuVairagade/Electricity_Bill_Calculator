❤️Example:
Suppose the rate of electricity bill is as followed:

For 1 to 50 units – 30Rs/unit
For 50 to 100 units – 35Rs/unit
For 100 to 150 units – 40Rs/unit
For 150 units and above – 50Rs/unit
So calculate the electricity bill for 300 units?


👻 Program Explanation 👻
1. Use the scanf() function to get user input for units and store it in units variable.
2. Create a function named electricity_bill and passed the parameter units entered by the user.
3. using if – else if and else ladder specify the condition that says if units is less than 50 then return product of units and 30, else if the units is less than 100 it means it has to return 1st 50 units at 30 Rs rate and remaining at 35 Rs rate. So return (50 × 30) + (units – 50) × 35 and so on for other ranges.
4. Print the result using printf() function


😍 Runtime Test Cases 😍
Testcase 1: In this case, we input “300” as units to calculate the electricity bill. (1 to 50 units – 30Rs/unit, 50 to 100 units – 35Rs/unit, 100 to 150 units – 40Rs/unit and 150 units and above – 50Rs/unit)
Enter the units: 300
The electricity bill is: 12750

Testcase 2: In this case, we input “180” as units to calculate the electricity bill. (1 to 50 units – 30Rs/unit, 50 to 100 units – 35Rs/unit, 100 to 150 units – 40Rs/unit and 150 units and above – 50Rs/unit)
Enter the units: 180
The electricity bill is: 6750
